            <p>My hobbies outside of work include reading and 3D printing. I enjoy designing items using CAD software and being able to print them using my 3D printer.</p> 
        <h1>Interest in Information Technology.</h1>
            <p>I have long been interested in IT, since I was about 14. As I imagine many people’s interest in IT began, I was really into computer games, and my first IT project was assembling a gaming PC with purchased parts. Installing the operating system and required drivers. 
                It took me over a decade to decide to pursue IT as a career, circumstances in my early life meant I was unable to study and I instead took an apprenticeship as an electrician. This lasted for about a year before I decided I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life working like this. I proceeded to bounce between jobs in varying industries. I’ve been a croupier at the casino, a bookkeeper and a production manager at an engineering company.
                 
                </p>
                <p>Although interesting as these jobs were, it never felt compelling. I spent a long time contemplating about the direction the world was headed within my working life and what skills would be necessary in this world. I began to notice a lot of issues at work that could be eliminated by the proper use of technology and how much more efficient we could become if we were properly able to implement and sync certain software. I truly believe the world is going to see more and more automation throughout nearly all industries, and that the ability to design and implement these systems is going to be largely in demand. In addition, I believe that as our reliance on technology grows, so too should our understanding of how it works, if not least of all for security purposes and the possible ways the technology we’re so reliant on can be exploited.
 
                </p>
                <p>During my studies at RMIT, I would like to gain as much exposure to programming and networking as I can, and how different areas of Information Technology relate, and interact with each other in the real world. I would expect to learn industry standards and protocols pertaining to IT in a corporate environment, as well as best practices.     
                </p>
         <h1>Ideal Job</h1>     
                <p> 
                    My ideal job would be challenging and changing. I’d like for the work I’m doing to feel impactful and also learn whilst I’m doing it. I would prefer a job with flexible hours working towards deliverables as opposed to a set roster each day. It would involve a lot of thinking and problem solving, and developing software.
                    </p>

                    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51762589?type=standout#searchRequestToken=b6460f42-e67c-4cd7-ae73-71672f7cefde">Link to Seek advert</a>    
                    <p>This position sounds like an ideal job for me because it is exactly what drew me to pursue IT as a career. It’s designing and developing custom software solutions for complex business problems, using critical thinking to break down problems and create solutions. This sounds appealing to me because each new project will be a different challenge, forcing continuous growth and learning. The ability to work remote is another appealing factor, and with it the ability to work towards deadlines with flexible hours, rather than forced to be somewhere during certain hours.</p>
                    <p>This position seems like an attainable goal for a graduate student, they request a relevant IT degree and 2 years of experience or a recent graduate that can prove themselves. There’s a long list of programming languages that they highly regard proficiency in, these include; C#, Python and it’s libraries; NumPy and Pandas, Typescript, PHP and more. In addition to being proficient with different frameworks like .NET and Django. They seek someone with analytical problem solving skills, good written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work autonomously. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My technical skills relevant to this job currently are negligible at this point in time. Although I’m working towards the degree they describe and fully intend to be at least comfortable in most, if not all the languages they described in my 3 year journey. I do feel I possess the majority of the soft skills they describe, a benefit I think comes from having had working experience in enterprise environments before my studies. I intend to try and complete as many coding projects as I can whilst completing my studies to maximise my exposure to different languages and frameworks.</p>
         <h1>Profile</h1>  
         <h2>Myer-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
         <img src= MBPT.PNG width = "25%" height = "50%"> <img src=MBPT2.PNG height = "50%" width = "70%">
         <p>My results from the Myer-Briggs personality test indicated I was a Logician INTP-t. This means ;
            Introverted
            INtuitive
            Thinking
            Prospecting
            Turbulent
            At first, I was a little sceptical of taking an online personality test but after having read through the result, there are plenty of things that resonated with me. I had written the section about my ideal job prior to having taken this test, and I can notice comments I made in that section described almost exactly the same in the test results. Like my preference to work in creative bursts towards deadlines, rather than stagnant daily routines. 
            <p>“All Logicians really want is to immerse themselves in an interesting project, and anything that interrupts that, be it overactive managers, the need to manage others, or office parties or meetings, are simply unwelcome burdens. “</p>
             
            A logician remains so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all, an issue I’ve noticed in my working life. I’m constantly reevaluating and second guessing whether I’ve missed something and if it really is the best informed decision, and I do tend to live primarily in my head, with a lot of thoughts never coming to fruition. I am most definitely less interested in the anecdotal and subjective when talking with people and prefer to discuss ideas or theories. Unfortunately logicians thrive in solitude, which can make working in teams difficult, but they can be complemented by various other personality types.
             
             
           <p>According to a test at http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz I am a visual learner, this is closely followed by Auditory learning. I think I agree with this, based on habits I’ve noticed about myself. I understand and remember things best by watching tutorials and seeing the process.</p>

            <img src=BIG5.PNG width = "25%" height = "50%"> <img src=BIG52.PNG width = "25%" height = "50%">
            <p>I took this Big 5 personality type test at <a href = "https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test</a>, and again found a lot of the results resonated with me despite my scepticism at the start. They suggest I have a moderate interest in art and design, but am likely not confident in my skills, which I’ve noticed with my 3D printing, often opting to design more practical and useful applications than aesthetically appealing ones. They also suggest based on my responses that I’m a critical thinker who’s often disturbed by unpleasant thoughts and may have trouble focusing which I find to be largely true also. Having taken these tests, and noticing similarities crop up between them has really drawn my attention to which areas may need some focus and work if I am to truly perform best in a team. 
            </p>
      <h1>Project</h1>      
            <p> 
                The project I decided to create is a game application for the android platform. This will be a 2D tower defence style game built on the unity game engine. There will be waves of enemies following a predetermined path approaching the user's “base”. The user will be able to place turrets and traps along this path to kill the zombies before they reach the base. Successfully completing a wave requires having killed all zombies of that wave without any reaching the base and allows progression to the next wave. Each wave gets progressively harder and there’ll be a highscores system to track wave completion. I also want to introduce a currency system as rewards for completing waves and allowing the user to upgrade their weapons. The overall theme of the game is likely to change throughout development, for example it won’t be zombies but something else. Although the core concepts of the tower defence, the highscores system and the currency system will remain.
                </p>
            <p>After a lot of contemplation between different project ideas, I finally settled on one. At first, I considered making something out of 3D printed parts, driven by a small electric motor and controlled via an arduino and a GUI, but I wanted a project that would expose me a little more  to a few different areas of coding. I then began to consider a desktop application to display location of inventory in real time that I could use at work, but decided getting the necessary access to certain things to make it work would prove difficult and ultimately wasn’t a beginner friendly task, nor too appropriate for a group project. I then settled on developing a game for Android, using the Unity game engine. This project felt like the right balance of challenging whilst also achievable. Majority of the resources were readily available online often with tutorials included, and I intentionally added certain features to make use of different languages.
 
            </p>
            <p>The game will allow a building period of as long as the user likes for them to set up their defences for the incoming wave, once happy with their layout they can start the wave and see if they survive. Zombies will have a hitpoint system with each successful hit from a turret dealing varying amounts of damage until the zombies hit points reach zero. Completion of a wave will award coins and experience depending on wave level. The combination of these coins and experience can be spent to upgrade existing weapons damage to zombies and buy new weapons. As wave level increases as will difficulty, in both the form of zombies having more health, and there being more of them. Once the user fails to complete a wave, by a zombie reaching the base, the game will record their wave level and display it in a highscores menu, allowing them to see previous attempts and record their latest one. There will be a GUI where the player can select to play, visit the shop to upgrade their weapons or view the highscores. A lot of the specific figures like zombie hit points, damage weapons deal, how much experience and coins are rewarded for certain levels and how much are required for certain upgrades for example will be balanced and tweaked throughout development. Ultimately given a long enough time frame, I’d like to have the game to a point it’s refined enough and bug free enough to release on the app store.
            </p>
            <p>This game will be built upon the freely available unity game engine. It will utilize C# as the main language. It will also potentially require some SQL to build and implement the database for the highscores system. Although I have no experience with any of these tools, there is a plethora of resources available online and I am excited about having a project to work towards and utilize these. Depending on the scale of the project, it could require some server space from somewhere like AWS to store its database ect. There will likely be a lot to learn about API’s. There’s a wide range of software and hardware involved and I am excited to learn how they all interact.</p>
